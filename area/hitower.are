can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

oblivious to your presence.

knowledge are on every wall. A large oaken desk is in the center, with
many parchments and scrolls on it. The most notable thing in the room is
a small set of scales, which floats about eye level. In perfect balance,
the scales are no doubt a sign of the master's neutrality.
